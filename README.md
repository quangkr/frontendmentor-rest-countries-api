# Frontend Mentor - REST countries API solution

This is my solution to the [REST countries API on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca)

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode (optional)

## Progress

- [x] Basic markup and styling
- [x] REST API handling
- [x] Client-side filtering
- [x] Detail page
- [x] Dark mode
- [ ] Finishing touches
